    The Grid:
        1. There are 10 constraints in total.
        2. All the numbers should be a multiple of 9.
        2. Solution 1 has 5 digits and meet Solution 3 at its 4rd digit and Solution 5a at its 2nd digit
        3. Solution 2 has 4 digits and meet Solution 3 at its 2nd digit and Solution Solution 5a at its 1st digit
        4. Solution 3 has 5 digits and meet Solution 2 at its 1st digit and Solution 1 at its 4th digit
        5. Solution 4 has 5 digits and meet Solution 8 at its 4th digit
        6. Solution 5 needs 2 solution, 5a is across with 3 digits and meets Solution 2 at its 2nd digit and Solution 1 at its 1st digit, 5b is down with 6 digits and meet Solution 8 at its 2nd digit and Solution 9 at its 4th digit
        7. Solution 6 has 2 digits and meet with Solution 9 at its 1st digit
        8. Solution 7 has 4 digits and meet with Solution 9 at its 1st digit
        9. Solution 8 has 3 digits and meet with Solution 4 at its 2nd digit and Solution 5b at its 3rd digit
        10.Solution 9 has 7 digits and meets with Solution 5b at its 5th digit, Solution 6 at its 1st digit, Solution 10 at its 3rd digit and Solution 7 at its 4th digit
        11.Solution 10 has 2 digits and meets with Solution 9 at its 1st digit
